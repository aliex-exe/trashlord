Howdy! I am Alexis Lienhard and I am a Digital Media Art Major and am attending San Jose State currently. At first I was only going to persue in graphic design, that was until I started my classes in DMA and GD I realized that I loved graphic design but I couldn't only persue design, so I decided to do Digital Media Art to get the best of both worlds and persue and discover more of my passions in design and the other arts as well.
I was born and raised this way since day one. My sport is Cheer and my job is Modeling. If you have a problem or want to hire me contact me.</h5>

 <h1 style="font-size: 30px">The Journey</h1> 
 <br>
<h5 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">I've been doing art for as long as I remember from digtially on my Wacom to my laptop and if it wasn't digital it was physical art like painting or sketching. At one point I even ventured into drumming and guitar, to help create and understand sound and audios effect in art as well.
 <br> 
Starting at broadcasting as a freshman in highschool to graphic design my senior year of high school. I interned the summer of 2018 when I graduated as a graphic designer for Lovegevity. I also was the graphic designer for SJSU's VS/PINK Campus Rep Club, I designed t-shirts for the San Jose State cheerleading team, and now I'm the Director of Social Events for Delta Gamma Sorority.</h5>
